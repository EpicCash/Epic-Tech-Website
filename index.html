        <p>The Epicenter ecosystem was designed to address the flaws inherent in Bitcoin, so as to deliver on Nakamoto’s original vision, in which large numbers of small transactions are processed efficiently, anonymously and securely on a decentralized network of lightweight nodes.</p>
        <p>With its triumvirate of digital assets – EPIC (Epic Cash), EUSD (soft-pegged stable coin) and ECR (reserve token) – the Epicenter ecosystem combines a store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account to deliver the solid monetary platform that decentralized finance requires.</p>
